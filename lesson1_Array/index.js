//1. it should have a place to store todos


var todos =["item1", "item2", "item3"];

//2. it should have a way to display todos

// console.log(todos); // how to display 

//3. it should have a way to add new todos

todos.push("item4");

//4. it should have a way to change todos

// target the item needing change in the array by selecting its index
// expample changing item1 to "item1 updated" will look like this

todos[0]= "item1 updated"


//5. it should have a way to delete todos

/* to delete an item off of array we can use the splice()function 
this function takes 2 params 
first is the index of the item 
second is the number of items to be deleted after the selected index*/

todos.splice(0,1);

//add an item
todos.push("item0", "item17", "item23")

//delete items
todos.splice(3, 3)

// if you try to delete a non existing index you'll get an empty array




console.log("My Todos: ", todos)
